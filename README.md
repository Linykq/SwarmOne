# SwarmOne

**Multi-model orchestration and consensus AI engine.**

---

## Overview

SwarmOne is a modular orchestration framework that runs multiple LLM candidates (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.) in parallel, applies scoring/voting logic, and selects a high-confidence consensus output. It enables fault tolerance, provider abstraction, and cost-aware decision making in multi-model AI environments.

---

## Features

- ⚙️ **Parallel execution of LLM candidates** via unified API abstraction (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini / etc.)
- 🧠 **Consensus engine** with scoring, weighted voting, fallback heuristics
- 🔄 **Resilient multi-backend design** with retry, circuit breaker, and failover support
- 📊 **Web console** for prompt testing, run tracing, A/B comparison, and error debugging
- 💰 **Token-level cost tracking** with support for caching and adaptive routing
- 🚀 **Extensible SDK and REST API** with correlation IDs, structured logs, and consensus metadata

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Gin (Go), gRPC, Postgres
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript
- **LLM Providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Gemini
